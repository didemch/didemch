- 😄 I enjoy working with R, Python, and SQL

I am a data analyst interested in uncovering insights and solving complex problems. I enjoy transforming data into actionable insights using  R, Python, and SQL. I'm passionate about organizing and cleaning up messy data to create visually appealing graphs and charts that tell a story. Plus, I love using advanced techniques to predict future trends and outcomes based on historical data.
